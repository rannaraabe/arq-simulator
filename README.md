# arq-simulator
This program was made to simulate an actual system focusing on it's memmory management and memory integrity. The user define the number of cores(only multiples of 2), then, the program creates a cpu with the given number of cores, creates its l1 cache, l2 cache and the primary virtual memory. So we don't have memory problems, the caches and the memory itself are multiples.
